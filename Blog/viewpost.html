                        <h2>6 reasons why we love dogs.</h2>

                    <p>
                        As a dog owner, you know how lovable your dog is. But here are six of the many reasons we all love our dogs!
                    <ol>
                        <h4><li>Dogs Make Us Laugh.</li></h4>
                        Whether it’s the pooch in our own backyard, the hilarious image we see on social media, or a funny video, dogs make us smile, chuckle and LOL! All dogs are natural comedians.
                        <h4><li>They Comfort Us When We Are Blue.</li></h4>
                        Therapy dogs are used to soothe soldiers and civilians with PTSD. They visit long term care homes and psychiatric facilities spreading joy everywhere they go. When we feel down our own dogs cuddle up to make us feel better. You can’t deny the magical healing and soothing abilities of dogs all over the world.
                        <h4><li>Dogs Listen To Our Problems.</li></h4>
                        You can tell your pup about your difficult day at work, or a date gone wrong. We know we can tell our dogs anything and they’ll never spill the beans.
                        <h4><li>They Teach Us To Be More Human.</li></h4>
                        Dogs are kind, loving, and compassionate – they forgive everything and never hold a grudge. No matter what a dog is doing, they are always present in the moment. If you watch your dog throughout the day you’ll find that your dog is a better person than most humans.
                        <h4><li>Dogs Keep Us Happy and Healthy.</li></h4>
                        The relationship you have with your dog is good for your heart and your soul. Positive feelings, increased activity, affection and security are the building blocks of a happy and healthy life. Coming home to a dog helps reduce stress and walking a dog can help keep you healthy.
                        <h4><li>They Love Us More Than They Love Themselves.</li></h4>
                        In the 1800’s Henry Wheeler Shaw wrote “A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself,” and the saying holds true to this day. Your dog would happily risk his or her life to protect the humans they love, and we love them right back.
                        </br>
                        No matter what breed of dog you have, we know you love them, so show your love by feeding them a quality dog food like Royal Canin. A healthy dog will live a long and happy life, and that’s all any of us wants for our furry family members.
